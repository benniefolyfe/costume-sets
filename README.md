## ðŸ’¬ About the project

This application enables the user to reverse the effects of completed tasks or Blessing spells by setting their buffs to negative values. It works on the principle that certain negative Character Stats will reverse their effects on the player and their party.

Boss Healing reverses the user's Strength by setting it to a negative number. Completing a task will then deal negative damage, which adds health to the party's quest boss, healing it and potentially adding health beyond its maximum HP.

Reverse Blessing reverses the user's Constitution by setting it to a negative number. Casting the Blessing skill will provide negative healing, thereby causing damage to your party members.
